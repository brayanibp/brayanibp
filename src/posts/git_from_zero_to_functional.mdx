## 1. Introduction to Git and GitHub
### What is Git?
Git is a **version control system (VCS)** designed to manage and track changes to code over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, manage different versions, and keep a history of changes.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration, like issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews.

### Why Use Git and GitHub?
- **Track Changes**: You can revert to previous versions easily.
- **Collaborate**: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
- **Backup**: Keeps a remote copy of your project that can be accessed anywhere.

---

## 2. Setting Up Git
### Installing Git
1. **Windows**:
   - Download the Git installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
   - Follow the setup instructions.
   
2. **macOS**:
   - Install via Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install git
     ```

3. **Linux**:
   - Install via your package manager (Debian/Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install git
     ```

### Configuring Git
After installing, configure Git with your user information:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

You can check your configuration with:
```bash
git config --list
```

---

## 3. Basic Git Commands
### Initialize a Repository
Create a new Git repository in your project folder:
```bash
git init
```

### Cloning a Repository
To clone an existing GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

### Checking Repository Status
See which files have changed:
```bash
git status
```

### Staging and Committing Changes
1. **Stage files** (prepare them for commit):
   ```bash
   git add <filename>   # To add specific files
   git add .            # To add all changes
   ```

2. **Commit your changes** (save the changes to history):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```

### Viewing Commit History
View a list of commits:
```bash
git log
```

---

## 4. Collaborating on GitHub
### Pushing Changes to GitHub
After committing, push changes to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git push origin main  # or master depending on the branch
```

### Pulling Changes from GitHub
Get the latest changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 5. Branching and Merging
### Creating and Switching Branches
Branches allow you to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main project. To create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

Switch between branches:
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Merging Branches
To merge your branch into `main`, first switch to `main`:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch-name
```

---

## 6. Resolving Conflicts
When multiple people make changes to the same file, Git may encounter conflicts. Conflicts need to be resolved manually:
1. Open the file with the conflict.
2. Edit the conflicting sections marked by Git.
3. After resolving, stage and commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add conflicted-file
   git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
   ```

---

## 7. Pull Requests and Code Reviews
A **Pull Request (PR)** is a request to merge changes from one branch into another (usually from your branch into `main`).
1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```

2. Create a pull request on GitHub:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click **Pull Requests** > **New Pull Request**.
   - Select the branch and submit your PR.

### Code Reviews
Before merging, other developers can review your code. They might suggest changes, which can be made by updating your branch and pushing the changes.

---

## 8. Setting Up SSH for GitHub
### Why Use SSH?
Using SSH allows you to securely interact with your GitHub repository without needing to enter your password every time you push or pull changes.

### Generating an SSH Key
1. **Generate a new SSH key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   When prompted, press Enter to accept the default location. Optionally, you can set a passphrase for extra security.

2. **Start the SSH agent**:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

3. **Add your SSH key to the agent**:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Copy your SSH key to the clipboard**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   Copy the entire output.

### Adding Your SSH Key to GitHub
1. Go to GitHub and click on your profile picture, then navigate to **Settings**.
2. On the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Click **New SSH Key**.
4. Paste the SSH key from your clipboard, name it, and click **Add SSH Key**.

Now, your GitHub account is configured to use SSH for secure communication.

## 9. App Authorizations on GitHub
GitHub allows third-party applications to access your account to automate workflows or provide additional tools.

### Authorizing Applications
1. Go to your **GitHub Settings**.
2. On the left sidebar, click **Applications**.
3. Here you will find two tabs: **Authorized OAuth Apps** and **Authorized GitHub Apps**.
   - **OAuth Apps**: These apps authenticate with GitHub via OAuth and might request various permissions.
   - **GitHub Apps**: Apps installed on specific repositories or the entire GitHub account.

### Authorizing a New App
- To authorize a new OAuth app:
  1. You will usually be redirected to GitHub from the app's website.
  2. GitHub will ask for permission to grant the app access to your account.
  3. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**.

You can always revoke or modify permissions from the same settings page.

## 10. Creating a Personal Access Token
### Why Use a Personal Access Token?
GitHub has deprecated password-based authentication for Git operations, so a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is used as a secure alternative for authentication.

### Steps to Create a Personal Access Token
1. **Go to GitHub**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub profile and click on **Settings**.

2. **Access Developer Settings**:
   - On the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.

3. **Generate a New Token**:
   - Under **Personal Access Tokens**, click **Tokens (classic)**, then click **Generate new token**.

4. **Set Token Scopes**:
   - Give your token a name and set an expiration date (optional).
   - Select the scopes (permissions) you want to grant the token. For basic repository usage, check:
     - `repo`: Full control of private repositories.
     - `workflow`: Write access to actions and workflows.
     - `admin:repo_hook`: Read/write access to repository hooks.
   
5. **Generate and Store the Token**:
   - After selecting the scopes, click **Generate token**.
   - **Important**: Copy the token immediately and store it securely (you won’t be able to see it again).

### Using the Token for Git
To use your personal access token, you’ll replace your GitHub password with the token when performing Git operations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

When prompted for your password, use the personal access token instead of your password.

## 11. Best Practices
- **Commit Often**: Make small, meaningful commits with clear messages.
- **Use Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- **Pull Regularly**: Frequently pull changes from the remote repository to avoid conflicts.
- **Code Reviews**: Always create a pull request and get a code

 review before merging to `main`.

---

## 12. Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to Pull**: Always pull the latest changes before starting new work.
- **Commit Messages**: Avoid vague messages like “fixed stuff.” Be specific about the changes you made.
- **Not Using Branches**: Directly committing to `main` can lead to conflicts and unstable code.

---

## 13. Conclusion
This guide serves as a starting point for developers who are new to Git. Follow these steps and best practices to confidently manage your projects and collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub.
